			Jukebox: In our final Scratch Project of Week 1, we were assigned to create a program, combined with a visual, will play music with user control.  I created my project to look like an iPod which plays three songs, Hotel California-The Eagles, Mirrors-Justin Timberlake, Let it Go-Elsa.  This project was created with Scratch.

			City Scroller: Similar to most Mario Brothers Games, we have created a background which moves at a different speed.  We can also add new buildings which will move at different speeds.  City Scroller was created in Python.
